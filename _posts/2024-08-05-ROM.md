In modern personal computers, the ROM, specifically used for storing the BIOS or UEFI firmware, typically ranges in size from **4 MB to 32 MB**. 

- **BIOS (Basic Input/Output System):** In older systems, the ROM size for BIOS was usually around 1 MB to 8 MB. However, as firmware has become more complex with additional features and graphical interfaces, the size has increased.

- **UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface):** In newer systems, UEFI firmware is more common and usually requires more space than traditional BIOS. The ROM size for UEFI can range from 16 MB to 32 MB or more, depending on the manufacturer and the specific features included in the firmware.

This ROM size is sufficient to store the necessary code and data for the computer to initialize hardware, perform self-tests, and boot the operating system. The actual size can vary depending on the complexity of the firmware and any additional features that are built into it, such as a graphical interface, security modules, or networking capabilities.
