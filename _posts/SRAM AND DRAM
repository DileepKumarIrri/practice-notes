**Static RAM (SRAM) and Dynamic RAM (DRAM)** are two types of Random Access Memory (RAM) used in computers and other electronic devices. Here’s how they differ:

### 1. **Structure and Storage Mechanism:**
   - **SRAM:** 
     - Uses **flip-flops** made of transistors to store each bit of data.
     - Each bit is stored in a stable state using 4 to 6 transistors.
     - Does not need to be refreshed as long as power is supplied.

   - **DRAM:**
     - Uses a **capacitor** and a single transistor for each bit of data.
     - Capacitors hold the charge (representing data), which tends to leak over time.
     - Requires periodic refreshing to maintain data.

### 2. **Speed:**
   - **SRAM:** 
     - Faster because it doesn’t need to be refreshed.
     - Offers quicker access times, making it suitable for cache memory.

   - **DRAM:**
     - Slower due to the need for refreshing and slower access times.
     - Typically used for the main system memory.

### 3. **Density and Size:**
   - **SRAM:** 
     - Lower density due to the complex structure of flip-flops.
     - Larger in size compared to DRAM.

   - **DRAM:**
     - Higher density because it uses a simpler design (1 transistor + 1 capacitor).
     - Smaller in size, allowing for more memory in a given space.

### 4. **Power Consumption:**
   - **SRAM:** 
     - Consumes less power in active use but more power at idle because it maintains data without refreshing.
   
   - **DRAM:**
     - Consumes more power due to constant refreshing but generally uses less power per bit in active use compared to SRAM.

### 5. **Cost:**
   - **SRAM:** 
     - More expensive to produce due to its complex structure and lower density.
   
   - **DRAM:**
     - Cheaper because it’s simpler to manufacture and has higher density.

### 6. **Applications:**
   - **SRAM:**
     - Used in CPU cache, registers, and small amounts of high-speed memory.
   
   - **DRAM:**
     - Used as the main memory in computers and devices where larger amounts of memory are required.

**In summary**, SRAM is faster and more expensive, making it ideal for high-speed cache memory, while DRAM is slower but more cost-effective and is used for the main system memory in most computers.
